# CVIP-Netflix-Clone

The Netflix Clone project aims to replicate the user interface of the popular streaming service Netflix, providing users with a visually appealing and responsive 
platform for discovering and exploring movies and TV shows. This project primarily focuses on the front-end development using HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly 
experience that mirrors the key features of the actual Netflix website.
